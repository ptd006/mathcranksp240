# Math Cranks p240

Nostalgia from desktop of old hard drive.  Clearly written after reading "Mathematical Cranks" by Underwood Dudley.

p240, conjecture 27- "every even number is the sum of a Fibonacci number and a prime, except 148 and 208"

Actually 148 can be written as the sum of a prime and Fibonacci in two ways:
59 (17th prime) + 89 (11th Fib)
127 (31st prime) + 21 (8th Fib)

A few that can't be written this way: 208 (yes), 416, 718, 768, 784, 926.
